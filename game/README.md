###About the game
This game is a replication of the classical arcade game Frogger with a few different features.  
###Description
Your goal is to avoid the bugs on your way to reaching the water.  If you collide with one of the bugs you will be reset back to your starting location for you to try again and you lose a life.  You have a max of three lives.
Each time you reach the water you will receive a point.
###Enemies
The bugs are the main.  The bugs will scurry past the screen at varying speeds.
###How to start playing the game
Download the game files or fork them from github [Link](https://github.com
Open index.html in your browser
The game will start with your character in position and ready to play.  
###Game Mechanics 
Moving is the only mechanic and is done by using the arrows (left, right, up, and down)
###Restarting the game
To restart the game just press the refresh page button or press F5
###Future Work
I need to figure out how to display and take awya hearts when you lose them in the game.
