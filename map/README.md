This is my capstone Project for my Front End Web Development Nanodegree

This application will show you live concerts that will be playing in Boston today and you can get a link to the tickets for that concert if they have a link avalible.  

Click on the button to drop down the list of concerts playing today and click on the names to go to that location on the map and open up the info window.  

##How to load the website

Download the files or fork them from github https://github.com/mathewCortez/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map.com Open index.html in your browser. You can also enter the ink for the project index.html page into https://htmlpreview.github.io/ and that will run the website.

Thanks to the people in discussion forums for some help with linking up the data from the api to the google maps.  

This discussion helped me set up the markers and the search function - https://discussions.udacity.com/t/no-idea-how-to-implement-the-search-function/182184/27.  It gave me some helpful hint.

I also tried used the yelp api to do a best bars in a certain area thing, but I could not get it working.  

This discusion get me close to getting the yelp Api working.  I got a new error message which felt like progress but I justed decided to use an api that could be set up more like the Wikipedia Api so I can use the videos as a reference.
